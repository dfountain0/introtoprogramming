*Servers*
-Computers that host the files that make up the web
*Internet*

Unit 2 (Lesson 4)

***HTML***
-Hyper-Text Mark-Up Language
-HTML is made of content(Content you see)
--Mark-up (what it looks like)
--References to other documents (i.e. images, videos, etc)
--Links to other pages

-Html Mark-up is made up of tags
-Tags are structure like (<opening tag> conntent </closing tag> and everything from the opening and closing tag is the element
-Bold tag <b></b>-stands for bold: <b>anything between the bold tag appears bold</b>
-em tag <em></em>-stands for emphasis-Makes Italics:<em>anything between the bold tag appears italicised</em>

***Ambiguity***

-Ambiguity is being open to 
-Computers are "stupid" in the sense that Computers can't make a decision or and inference unless you tell it to. 
-Programming languages are designed to limit abiguity

***Missing a closing tag***
-If you miss a closing tag everything after the opening tag will be effected by the elements commands or properties
-I.E hello my namd is <b> Don SMitty Weberben Jegermen Jetsen

***HTML Attributes***

-<tag attr="Value"> content</tag>
-Attributes have a value
-A tag can have multiple attributes
-I.E achor tag-<a> anchors are for making links</a>
-I.E href is an attribute I.E <a href="htttps://www.facebook.com">blah</a>

***Image***

-Image tag-<img>
-Image tag has an attribute called src which stands for source
-I.E <img src"http://www.loveimagesdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/love-wallpapers-23.jpg">
-Image tags also have an attribute called alt(alternate)- which is meant to replace an image that has a broken link with text
-I.E <img src="http://www.loveimagesdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/love-wallpapers-23.jpg" alt="Image of a Heart">
-Images don't have a closing tag
-Tags with no closing tags are called Void Tags, Void tags have no content, because they have no content, they don't need a closing tag.

-It's Okay to forget. There are resources such as w3 school and MDN.

***Line Breaks***
-If you want text that is too long, you use a line break <br> tag like this <p> this is how you make <br> a line break tage</p>
-<br> tags are Void Tags
-Another way to make line breaks are to use <p>Multiple</p> <p>Tags</p>
