                    <p>-Your browser makes requests via the Internet to servers.</p>
                    <p>-The requests are using a protocol called HTTP(Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol)</p>
                    <p>-And the servers respond with files that the browser displays.</p>
                    <p>-These servers are used to host files intead of browsing the files</p>
                    <p>-The HTTP protocol is a protocol the browser uses to communicate with the servers</p>

                    <p><b>The&lt;br&gt;</b>tag is a Void Tag</p>
                    <p>-Another way to make line breaks are to use &lt;p&gt;Multiple&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags&lt;/p&gt;</p>
                    <p>-<b>The &lt;p&gt;&lt;</b>tag stands for Paragraph. </p>

                    <p><b>--You've learned a lot so far! Let's recap some of the big ideas:</b></p>
                    
                    <p><b>--The World Wide Web</b></p>
                    <p>-The web is composed largely of HTML documents. 
                    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the language 
                    the browsers use to interpret web pages. The components of the web include the client (your computer and browser), the Internet, and servers. The client and servers interact through something called the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</p>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <b>--Basic HTML Elements</b>
                    <p>-HTML elements are what we use to tell a web browser how to display content on a web page.</p>
                    <p>-Most HTML elements consist of an opening and a closing tag with some content between them.</p> 
                    
                    <p><b>&lt;b&gt;text&lt;/b&gt;</b>-Makes the 'text' content bold</p> 
                    <p><b>&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;</b>Makes the 'text' content italic</p> 
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <b>--HTML Attributes</b>
                    <p>-Some elements accept additional values called attributes in their opening tags. Attributes provide additional information to the browser. For example, the anchor tag takes an attribute called href that defines a URL to link to.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>&lt;a href="url"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;</b>-Creates a hyperlink to the href attribute value url and names it link</p>
                    <p><b>&lt;img src="url" alt="text"&gt;</b>-Displays the image hosted at the src attribute value "url" (this can also be a path to a local file on your computer). If the image cannot be displayed, then the alt attribute value "text" is shown.</p>    
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <b>--More HTML Elements</b>
                    <p>-<b>&lt;p&gt;text&lt;/p&gt;</b>Defines a paragraph. The content of the &lt;p&gt; element is in a "box"</p> 
                    <p>-<b>&lt;br&gt;</b> Creates a line break</p> 
                    <p>-<b>&lt;div&gt;content&lt;/div&gt;</b> Creates a "box" container element</p> 
                    <p>-<b>&lt;span&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;</b>Creates an "inline" container element</p>

                    <p>Which is a standard convention for representing & interacting</p>
                    <p> Each html tag creates an element in the dom which the browsers uses to display the page</p>
                    <p><b>CSS</b> allows you to use a specific rules and syntax to change how elements look on a page</p>

                    <p>browsers use default stylesheets to determine how to display HTML elements</p>
                    <p>Because these rules differ sometimes between browsers, there are efforts to promote consistency in styles across browsers. One popular solution to this issue is using what is referred to as a CSS reset such as normalize.css.</p>

                    <p>CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements.</p>


                    <b>How does CSS "control" HTML?</b>
                    <p>If you want to write CSS that makes all h1 elements have a black background and white text, you would write:</p>
                    
                    <b>CSS Vocabulary</b>
                    <p><b>CSS:</b> Cascading Style Sheets.
                    
                    <b>Style:</b> This word can refer to many things and so it can be confusing. It can refer to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The HTML element.</li>
                        <li>The HTML attribute.</li>
                        <li>The general look of a web page. For example: "I like that site's style."</li>
                        <li>A verb. For example: "I'm making progress on my page. The structure is all done but now I have to style it."</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <b>Rule:</b> a line of CSS code describing the value that a certain attribute should take.
                    <b>Property:</b> The property you want to change.
                    <b>Value:</b> The value that you want to assign to the attribute.
                    <b>Selector:</b> The name that you use to in order to target the elements that are assigned to a class or id attribute in the HTML.
                    <b>Class:</b> A class refers to a group of elements that can be styled together. Class names should not contain periods or any other punctuation marks such as class="1.1"
                    <b>ID:</b> ID's are unique identifiers that uniquely identifies an element in HTML.
                    </p>
                    
                    <b>Selecting by class</b>
                    <p>In the example above, we set the background-color of every h1 to black. If we only want to add style to certain h1s, we can use class selectors. Try copying the following code into a new HTML file in your text editor to see how this works. We should see a traffic light. Note how in the style element we refer to an HTML element's class name by writing .class-name. Also note how we can apply rules to all divs or just certain divs by using the appropriate selector.</p>
                    
                    <b>How do I include CSS Styling in my web page?</b>
                    <p>Method 1: Write CSS in the &lt;head&gt; of your HTML using &lt;style&gt;</p>
                    <p>Method 2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file</p>
                    <p>Method 3: Write your style inline with your HTML. This is generally a very bad idea because it leads to lots of repeated code. But you may see code that uses this method so it's good to be familiar with it. . Ex. &lt;div style="background-color: red; color: white"&gt;</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Cont. of CSS</h3
                    
                    <b>The Box Model</b>
                    <p><b>Content:</b>The very center, the text or image that appears on the website</p>
                    <p><b>Padding:</b>Clears the area around the content</p>
                    <p><b>Border:</b>Goes around the Content and Padding</p>
                    <p><b>Margin:</b>The area around the border</p>
                    <p>By default the size of the element is equal to the sum of border, padding, and content width</p>
                    <p>CSS style box-sizing: border box-makes the calculation of the element size include both the border and padding, so its easier to make layouts. Margin is not included.</p>
                    <p>In order for browsers to be able to display new styles, you have to include broswer secific prefixes</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>-webkit</li>

                    <h3>Box Sizing and Positioning Summary</h3>
                    
                    <b>Box Sizing</b>
                    <p>There are four main points that Jessica addressed about box sizing.</p>
                    <p>HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.</p>
                    <p>Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.</p>  
                    <p>There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.</li>
                        <li>Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.</p>
                    
                    <b>Box Positioning</b>
                    <p>Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.</p>
                    <p>Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.</p>
                    
                    <b>Code, Test, Refine</b>
                    <p>Write some <b>CODE</b>,<b>TEST</b> it, <b>Refine</b> it.</p>
